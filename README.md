# Wikkit
 
A Wikipedia reader app for android, providing infinitely scrolling lists of articles for some of the Wikipedia feeds availble from the Wikipedia API.

It was written using the Blazor-Maui hybrid framework.

This was made as a personal project mainly for my own use, and as a learning experience for app development. Please adjust expections of code quality accordingly!

Currently supported feeds:
- Random articles
- Recently changed articles
- Picture of the day
- Articles featured in current Events
- Most viewed articles*
- Search

\* The generator for the most viewed articles in the API is occasionally broken and will not return any results, see [here for details](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T254211)
